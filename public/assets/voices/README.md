# Voice Preview Pre-made Recordings

This directory contains pre-made audio recordings for the Voice Preview feature to reduce API calls and improve user experience.

## File Naming Convention

### Dashboard (Broadcaster Settings)
**Default Text**: "Welcome, everyone, to the stream!"

**File Format**: `{VoiceId}-welcome-everyone-to-the-stream.mp3`

**Example Files**:
- `Friendly_Person-welcome-everyone-to-the-stream.mp3`
- `Professional_Woman-welcome-everyone-to-the-stream.mp3`
- `Casual_Male-welcome-everyone-to-the-stream.mp3`
- `Energetic_Youth-welcome-everyone-to-the-stream.mp3`
- etc.

### Viewer Settings
**Default Text**: "Chat is this real?"

**File Format**: `{VoiceId}-chat-is-this-real.mp3`

**Example Files**:
- `Friendly_Person-chat-is-this-real.mp3`
- `Professional_Woman-chat-is-this-real.mp3`
- `Casual_Male-chat-is-this-real.mp3`
- `Energetic_Youth-chat-is-this-real.mp3`
- etc.

## Recording Requirements

Pre-made recordings will ONLY be used when:
- Text exactly matches the default message (case-insensitive)
- Pitch = 0 (default)
- Speed = 1.0 (default)
- Emotion = neutral or empty (default)
- Language Boost = auto/Automatic or empty (default)

Any deviation from these settings will trigger a new API call instead of using pre-made recordings.

## Adding New Recordings

1. Generate TTS audio using the default settings for each voice
2. Save as MP3 format
3. Name according to the convention above (exact VoiceId matching the dropdown)
4. Place in this directory

## Technical Details

- Format: MP3
- Sample Rate: As generated by TTS API (typically 24kHz)
- Bitrate: As generated by TTS API
- Channel: Mono or Stereo (as generated)

The application will gracefully fall back to API generation if a pre-made recording is not found.
